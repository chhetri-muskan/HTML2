    <h1 style="color: yellowgreen;">Web Development</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>I chose web development because it allows me to <mark>turn ideas into real, interactive websites</mark>. I love the creative freedom to design, code, and bring digital experiences to life. It’s exciting to see my work live on the internet, helping users and solving problems.</p>
    <p>Web development also gives me the chance to <mark>learn constantly</mark>, stay updated with new technologies, and explore both frontend and backend development.</p>
    <p>Whether it's for freelancing, personal projects, or future career goals, web development is the perfect mix of <mark>logic, creativity, and opportunity</mark> — and that’s why I love it!</p>
